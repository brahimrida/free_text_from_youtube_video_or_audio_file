Nothing beats a great cake, a sort of a show off trophy for party foods and I'm going to make them amazing, flourless chocolate cake. But with a twist, first thing First, make the caramel. Flatten the sugar. Never stir the caramel. Rule number one. Now keep the pan nice and flat. I'm going to flavor this caramel. with a little bit of mint. Give it a little chop. Springle that into the caramel. Don't get the caramel too dark. Just nice and light. a little teaspoon of oil onto the tray and rub that in and then pour out your camera that was making a caramel sauce. and I put butter and cream into the caramel, but I want this nice minted brittle running through my cake. Ostecannel cools down on a tray, I'm gonna make my cake. First melt good quality dark chocolate in a bambarie. Heating it directly in the pan would destroy the cocoa fats, always. in a bowl over boiling water. In a mixing bowl sugar, two whole eggs and three egg yolks. Wisk until beautifully light and creamy and the color changes to a light yellow. The more you mix the eggs in the sugar, the lighter that texture in the center of the chocolate cake. Next, melt some butter into your warm dark chocolate. And stir, push that really nice sheen, velvety, rich and tasting amazing. Have that. Do you sugar on your eggs? I give that a really good mix. When you're making flawless desserts, it really is important to work harder, incorporating it out especially. with the yolks and the sugar. That natural height is to take place at the beginning. Look at that. Looks like the perfect chocolate ganache. Then separate four egg whites. into a bowl. Now make sure you've got two thirds of the way there with your whites and then just sprinkle in you should go. Almost like the meringue and the firmer you make these now more. You'll elevate your cake and your oven. what you call a stiff peak in with the whites. Before I start mixing that, I'll get my camera. Just start. Break that up. Blast sheets of glass, beautiful. Save some of your minty camel shards for decoration. roll him into break up the rest into small pieces. Sprinkle that in. So as we start to slice that chocolate cake, you're coming across that nice crunch. Take your cake tin, make sure it's lined with the grease we've paper on the bottom. Nice to grease, pour this in. A few sharp taps on a hard service will rid your cake mixture of any air pockets that could create holes in your cake. Sit down the other 180. After 35 minutes, my chocolate mincake is cooked and whilst it cools down, I can whip up a pepper mince. cream topping. I've sifted icing sugar and a few drops of peppermint extract to double cream and whisk until it's just holding it's shape. Spoon your minty cream on top of the cake, leaving a small border free to make it easier to cut. For a cake that can't to attract attention at your party, scatter over the remaining caramel minchards. Thank you. you
