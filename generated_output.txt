Some of the best street food I've ever eaten was in Asia. Everyone those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all sent it around an Asian staple noodles. to cook those properly and we surprise our quick and easy piece to knock off the delicious dinner. First off, we're going to soak our noodles. Now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour a hot water over the rice noodles soak. and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up. If you've got a wok, perfect. If not, just a normal sized frying pan with big sloping sides. Pan on. Cut it really nice and hot. Chicken breast, very lean, highly-nifat. On there you've got this little fillet just sliced that on. Now the secret to get it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips. Take your knife, keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this bus of flour in the chicken take a rolling pin I'm best in gently roll over the chicken and what it does is sort of fattens it allows you to slice it even thinner And the thinner was slicing the chicken, the sort of crisper it gets, the quicker it cooks. Slice it in half. Start slicing. these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily. Next wash your knife and find nice garlic. The thin of a garlic, the crispier. This is a young tender broccoli. just slice them down, and want a bite to the broccoli. And all the sort of paste the dish with 1-3 noodles, 1-3rd vegetable. I'm one third of your protein chicken. With a dish that takes less than minutes to put together, it's really important to get everything organized. the tips touch of olive oil. They're pan-raising really nice. Just starting to smoke. Drop the chicken in first. Salt pepper. I'll do another little strands of chicken. Nice. When she started to stir off the chicken, get the garlic in. Now let that get really nice and crispy. The way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken and garlic of the side of the pan. You can see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because the colors and cook for the same time as well really really cool shots. Now that garlic get marinated. very nice and crispy, broccoli in. Still strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally the glance you've got in also dry out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps the seasoned it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in Probably. Exhaust water once I take it out Give it pan a little wipe out All too spoon of olive oil get out What? Really nice the oil again. Drain your noodles. They're beautiful. This is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry. Be classic, two eggs in, whisk up the eggs. Give that a ready good whisk. So the whole most spread it. I'm the side of the pan like you season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in and give that a really nice meat. I want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together. That egg is cooked. Make sure you got that nice, the even distribution of chicken, broccoli, garlic, lovely. And we just finished that fresh line and there you have a very simple delicious stir fry with rice noodles. Making your a nokey is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning as great way I'm using up leftover bait potatoes you can make knocking just with flour and eggs. However, potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture. It's got them in half. Take your spoon and scoop the inside. of those potatoes. I'm using leftover baked potatoes, but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes. Two choices. You can get a fork and sort of... mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or there's little gadget it's called a riser I suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently You can see how nice the light is. It's more like fluffy, it all strands up a tater. You can do this on a tater's heart. It'll go through the rice as so much quicker. Just slice that off there. Now, a nice spoon of a castering. I'll touch a salt and pepper. It's really important to season the mixture so we go along otherwise the knocking becomes really bland. Flour over the ricotta. Sift. There's no lumps. just like give that little whisk. Now make a little well in the center. I've got a nice soft, pliable ball of dough. Give that really good mix. Get some time flours in there. And this time is... Light fragrant, it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta, taste brilliant, just pick the little tips of the time plows. Next, flower your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough. Fold in and push. And basically all this dough is getting nice and smooth. start to get a little bit wet and just that little touch of flour once I think really nice and soft now don't overwork it. This stops the knot you from It's bending when it hits the pan. That's exactly what I want. And I sort of soft, fragrant ball. Cut the ball in half, like we flour. The hands and just roll it gently. Just think of a big long cigar. The mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots. So flour. Now lightly flour the knife. So when you slice the knocking, it doesn't stick. Cut the dough into bite sized pieces. Just take your finger, dip it in the flour and push it out. Why? I want my nokies and look like a pillow. And for me the most important part of there is that not one of them I by identity of the same shape. We'll also bring up to the boil, touch it all the more in there. Lightly flower your hand. Lift up the noki in to the rolling boiling water. Turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom. and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating. Get a pan on, get that nice and hot. Now they just start to come after the top. You can continue cooking them like that. I like blanching them in the water, take them out and then fry them. To set the nooky, heat all of them in a frying pan. Shently lift up and look. They doubled in size, drain it, get rid of excess water and straight into the hot pan. This is where they start to take on. I completely different texture. It's crisp. So-tay texture on the outside. Knock in loves fresh pepper. So pepper in and see I'm going to start turning them. I've got this really nice little sort ground. I'm almost popping up now and I look pastels. So I want the nice and soapy both sides. but light and creamy in the centre fresh garden peas and the buscals that are really nice sort of burn was that flavour on the end. Beautiful.
